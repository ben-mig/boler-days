      The original Canadian built Boler moulded fibreglass trailer was introduced in 1968.  The design offered a simple and lightweight family travel trailer.

Made by joining two moulded fibreglass halves (top and bottom) created a water tight and extremely durable shell.  Inside is cozy yet comfortable, it include a stove, fridge or ice box, sink with hand pump. 

Sleeping for 4 is available by lowering the rear dinette table between the seats to create a double bed ,and the front gaucho converts into bunk beds.
